## Hello and welcome ü§ù

### I'm CJ. I joined the School of Code's 8th bootcamp (Nov 2021 - Mar 2022) to transition from electronics engineering towards web development.

See [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) for more information on, in my opinion, one of the best bootcamps out there.

I'm pro-actively looking for predominantly Junior Full Stack Developer roles.
